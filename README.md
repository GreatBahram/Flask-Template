# Flask Template

## What is this 

Flask leaves the organization of your application up to you. This is one of the reasons why I liked it, but it does mean that you have to put some thought into how to structure your code. You could put your entire application in one file, or have it spread across multiple packages.

There are a few organizational patterns that you can follow to make development and deployment easier. And this is my way.

## How to use it?

Just clone it via:

`git clone https://github.com/GreatBahram/Flask-Template`

All requirements are in `requirements.txt` file. first of all, you should create `Virtualenv` then install those requirements (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`).
